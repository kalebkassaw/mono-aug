# mono-aug

A library of monotonic function IR image augmentations.

## Setup

First, create a file called ```filenames.json```. This file should look as follows:

```json
{"file_loc": "(file location in double quotes"}
```

The ```main.ipynb``` notebook uses the ```%s``` character to denote an unknown image name -- feel free to use this as needed to test out augmentations with specific images.
